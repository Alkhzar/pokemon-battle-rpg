A website where you can battle pokemon!

**Short Blog**

Today, March 30, 2022, I decided to create a working pokemon battle system with ui using only what I have learned in the #100Devs bootcamp so far.
I wasn't sure if I could actually do it, or if it would take too long for me to make. Despite it all, I went for it. To my surprise, I was
making a lot of progress quickly, and after a few hours, I had completed my project! Sure, I could definitly add more things to liven it up
a bit more such as, animations, sounds, and more complex battle logic, but I was more than satisfied where I left it. I hope you enjoy playing 
the game and going through the code!
